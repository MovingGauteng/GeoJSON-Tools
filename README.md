# GeoJSON-Tools

GeoJSON-Tools is a JavaScript module for working with location data, primarily using the GeoJSON specification.

We created GeoJSON-Tools from [rwt.to](//rwt.to) in order to use it on related projects that rely on GeoJSON (primarily from MongoDB's GeoJSON support).

You are welcome to use it, add feature and pull requests!
